# 118-congress-rural-urban
The 118th Congress rural-urban classification by district. 

The methodology to generate the classifications can be found [here](https://github.com/theatlantic/citylab-data/blob/master/citylab-congress/methodology.md) -- we did the same just using the 118th Congress district lines and more recent census data.
