# 118-congress-rural-urban
The 118th Congress rural-urban classification by district. 

The original methodology to generate classifications for the districts of the 112th congress can be found [here](https://github.com/theatlantic/citylab-data/blob/master/citylab-congress/methodology.md). To generate our classifications, we applied the same method just with more recent demographic data and with the 118th Congress congressional districts.

Feel free to use these classifications for your own project, but if you do, please credit David Montgomery.
